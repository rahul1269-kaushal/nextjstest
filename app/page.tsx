It must be a platform issue so just fix it for me instead of asking me questions.” Please write a follow-up reply to the customer.</h1>

          <p> Answer: Hello Customer_Name,

I completely understand your concerns and the frustration you're experiencing.

Could you please consider sharing access to your repository or making it public? This way, I can clone it and perform a test deployment on my end. From the troubleshooting conducted so far, I haven't identified any specific errors in the build logs that could indicate a platform issue.

If sharing repository access isn't feasible, could you provide details about the exact module where you're encountering the error? I can then try integrating that module into my test application for further investigation.

I'll be eagerly awaiting your response.</p>
